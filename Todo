TODO list for Perl module ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::PBP

- Implement 'use version' style for $self->{VERSION}, e.g., in Changes.
- Module::Starter::PBP uses 2-digit test numbers beginning with 00. DONE:
  Implemented in EU::MM 0.39_02 (Fri 09/09/2005)
- Module::Starter::PBP defaults to compact top-level directory;  EU::MM does
  not.  Have to fix.  DONE:  Tue Sep  6 19:12:25 EDT 2005
- t/testlib/Auxiliary.pm will have to be moved under eumm/lib so that (a) it
  gets installed with eumm and (b) other modules (i.e., subclasses such as
EU::MM::PBP) can import Auxiliary.pm's functions into the subclasses' test
suite.
