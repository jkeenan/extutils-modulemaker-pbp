=head1 VERSION

This document references version 0.02_01 of ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::PBP, released
to CPAN on September 8, 2005.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::PBP subclasses Perl extension ExtUtils::ModuleMaker.
If you are not already familiar with ExtUtils::ModuleMaker, you should read
its documentation I<now>.  The documentation provided below is intended
primarily for future maintainers and extenders of ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::PBP.

The default value settings and methods described below supersede the 
similarly named methods in ExtUtils::ModuleMaker.  When used as described 
herein, they will create a CPAN-ready Perl distribution the content of 
whose files reflects programming practices recommended by Damian Conway in 
his book I<Perl Best Practices> (O'Reilly, 2005) 
L<http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perlbp/>.

=head1 DEFAULT VALUES

The following default values for ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::PBP differ from
those set in F<ExtUtils/ModuleMaker/Defaults.pm>.

=over 4

=item *

Default to compact top directory.  E.g., F<Alpha-Beta-Gamma> instead of 
F<Alpha/Beta/Gamma>.

    $self->{COMPACT} = 1;

=item *

Default to placing C<use_ok> tests for multiple modules in a single F<t/*.t> 
file rather than one F<t*.t> file for each module.

    $self->{EXTRA_MODULES_SINGLE_TEST_FILE} = 1;

=item *

Count of F<t/*.t> files begins at 0 rather than 1.

    $self->{FIRST_TEST_NUMBER}  = 0;

=item *

In name of test file, test number is formatted as 2-digit rather than 3-digit.

    $self->{TEST_NUMBER_FORMAT} = "%02d";

[ REPLACE THIS...

  The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
  how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
  example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
  that should be understood before the module is installed.

  A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
  README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
  archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
  good idea to provide version information here so that people can
  decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.
]


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

END_OF_TOP

    my $makemaker_instructions = <<'END_OF_MAKE';
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
END_OF_MAKE

    my $mb_instructions = <<'END_OF_BUILD';
    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install
END_OF_BUILD

    my $README_middle = <<'END_OF_MIDDLE';

Alternatively, to install with Module::Build, you can use the 
following commands:

END_OF_MIDDLE

    my $README_bottom = <<"END_OF_README";

  Argument  : $module: pointer to the module being built
              (as there can be more than one module built by EU::MM);

 ====for author_to_fill_in
    List every single error and warning message that the module can
    generate (even the ones that will ''never happen''), with a full
    explanation of each problem, one or more likely causes, and any
    suggested remedies.

None.


 ====head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

 ====for author_to_fill_in
    A list of any modules that this module cannot be used in conjunction
    with. This may be due to name conflicts in the interface, or
    competition for system or program resources, or due to internal
    limitations of Perl (for example, many modules that use source code
    filters are mutually incompatible).

None reported.


 ====head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

 ====for author_to_fill_in
    A list of known problems with the module, together with some
    indication Whether they are likely to be fixed in an upcoming
    release. Also a list of restrictions on the features the module
    does provide: data types that cannot be handled, performance issues
    and the circumstances in which they may arise, practical
    limitations on the size of data sets, special cases that are not
    (yet) handled, etc.

=head1 PREREQUISITES

ExtUtils::ModuleMaker, version 0.40 or later.
L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/ExtUtils-ModuleMaker/>.

=head1 TO DO

ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::PBP is currently supported only when called within a
Perl script.  In an upcoming version, the F<modulemaker> utility will be
adapted to work with this extension, probably by providing a similarly
functioning but differently named command-line utility.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.
